Need build script to create releases
Currently there is no way to create a redistributable form of ghi.
I would like to have a process for creating a copy-pastable ghi install that can be used by people who aren't ghi developers.

--- changed strategy ---
Instead went with what appears to be a more common approach of having the entire ghi repository be the install directory.
This has the advantage of removing the need for an install script.
Unfortunately this also makes the root directory of the project very cluttered... but better modularization may help that in the future.
